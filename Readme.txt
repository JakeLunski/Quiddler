This program designed to help players of the game Quiddler find the highest-scoring word 
they can make with their current hand of cards. I did not receieve any assistance on this project,
I cited the sources I used which were the slides and cplusplus.com.

Code Explanation:
My code is split into several files with the functions that are provided:

Quidller.c includes the given files to run the regular Quiddler game. It takes in the input of cards and prints the possible words
that can be made from the dictionary with those cards. To run this game, you should enter the command 'make compile run'. This will enter
the program and prompt the user for input. From there, the program will search through the dictionary for possible words that can be formed
and output matches to the console. I go into furthur detail about specific functions and how they work in my Quiddler.h file. I also explain some of the 
tools I used in each functions.

Quiddler-x.c includes the given files to run the Quiddler game extra credit. It uses the same functionality of Quiddler.c, but has another function that gives each
card a point value. This program then determines the amount of points each matched word is worth. To run this game, you should enter the command 'make compile-x run-x'.
The program will output the matched words and their point value. I go into furthur detail about specific functions and how they work in my Quiddler-x.h file. I also explain some of the 
tools I used in each functions.
